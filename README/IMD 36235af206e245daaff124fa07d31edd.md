Algemene Nederlandse Bond van Meubelmakers, Behangers, Houtbewerkers en aanverwante vakgenoten. Dutch Trade union. Items that makes it community, cult:

- Posters
- Images (real life)
- Flags (for the different unions before 1982)
- Newspaper segments
- Metal/ glass holders/bowls (Christian)
- Pins, other physical totems

I choose an item that is static, meant for visual reference - to represent the always moving, dynamic trade union. Large selection of items that re all interconnected ranging from metal scales, fabric flags to portraits of the leaders, photos of busy workers. For me it is important to preserve these objects in a way which wont get yellow or dusty. Representing the power of these groups like they were when freshly initiated.

There were 2 dutch trade unions before 1982. The FNV was founded in 1976 as a federation of two unions, the Catholic NKV and the social-democratic NVV. The Protestant CNV originally also participated in the talks, but it refused to fully merge into a new union. The federation was founded because of declining membership, due to depillarization and increasing political polarization between left and right. The two fused officially in 1982. Wim Kok, who had already been chair of NVV between 1973 and 1976 became chair of the new organization, which he remained until 1986 when entered parliament for the PvdA.

As a result of the merger of the Dutch Trade Union Confederation (NVV) and the Dutch Catholic Trade Union Confederation (NKV) on 1 January 1982, the archives of the two old trade union federations and the trade unions affiliated with them were closed. To the extent that these archives were national, they were transferred to the International Institute of Social History (IISH) in Amsterdam or to the Catholic Documentation Center (KDC) in Nijmegen respectively, but nothing was arranged for the archives of local departments. To prevent this material from being lost, a working group was set up in Nijmegen to collect it and manage it in a safe place.

'The desire for revolution, which has been stirring political life for so long, had to change from the political to the adjacent socio-economic terrain. Indeed, the unprecedented growth of industry, the change in business technology, the change in the mutual relations between patron and workers, the accumulation of wealth among the few and the lack of the large masses, and on the one hand the greater self-consciousness of the workers, and on the other their closer mutual contiguous, moreover, the growing decay, - all these factors have sparked the battle. (…) The relationship between possessors and proletarians, of those who provide capital, and those who perform work, must be controlled. This battle question is full of dangers, since it is not infrequently misused by volatile and suspicious persons, to obscure the right insight and to incite the masses to uproar. Whatever the case, we clearly see that the proletariat must be cared for quickly and adequately, since a very large proportion of them are undeservedly in a miserable and miserable state. "

Rerum novarum is subtitled "On the Conditions of Labor". In this document, Pope Leo XIII articulated the Catholic Church's response to the [social conflict](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_conflict) that had risen in the wake of [capitalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalism) and [industrialization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrialization) and that had led to the rise of [socialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialism) and [communism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communism) as ideologies.

The pope declared that the role of the state is to promote [social justice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_justice) through the protection of rights, while the Church must speak out on social issues in order to teach correct social principles and ensure class harmony (rather than [class conflict](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_struggle)). He restated the Church's long-standing teaching regarding the crucial importance of private property rights, but recognized, in one of the best-known passages of the encyclical, that the free operation of market forces must be tempered by moral considerations:

> Let the working man and the employer make free agreements, and in particular let them agree freely as to the wages; nevertheless, there underlies a dictate of natural justice more imperious and ancient than any bargain between man and man, namely, that wages ought not to be insufficient to support a frugal and well-behaved wage-earner. If through necessity or fear of a worse evil the workman accept harder conditions because an employer or contractor will afford him no better, he is made the victim of force and injustice.[11]

Rerum novarum is remarkable for its vivid depiction of the plight of the nineteenth-century urban poor and for its condemnation of unrestricted capitalism. Among the remedies it prescribed were the formation of [trade unions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_union) and the introduction of [collective bargaining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_bargaining), particularly as an alternative to state intervention.

## **Wage printers or fellow fighters?Women and trade union movement in the Netherlands 1890-1920**

In 1975, the year of the woman, Joyce Outshoorn wrote about the dilemma in the modern trade union movement between the underpayment of female labor and its wage-dampening effect on men's wages, and women's right to full-fledged work with equal pay. With what arguments did the labor movement argue against female labor to protect women or get them back home, and when did the labor movement promote full work for women and equal pay for equal work? Outshoorn also provides a clear overview of the earliest professional organization of women.

Joyce Outshoorn, in: *Te elfder Ure 20, feminism 1.* Nijmegen, SUN, 1975.

## **National and international dimensions to the establishment of the NVV Women's Secretariat in 1959**

The history of the labor movement NVV Commission and Women's Secretariat NVV was initially attributed to the women of the Women's Association NVV in the history of the trade union movement. Bob Reinalda shows that this must be widened to the female managers of the unions, who, although few in number, were crucial for women's work and the representation of working women within the trade union movement. The NVV was not at the forefront internationally. To orientate themselves as to what a successful approach could be, these administrators lit their light at sister unions in England, Germany and Sweden.

Nvv had problems during the liberation of the Netherlands. However the groups resilience was strong.

**Experiences during war period**

***Growing dissatisfaction***The illegal press urged the NVV directors to resign. The criticism also became louder within the own organizations. Pamphlets were distributed and an illegal version of De Vakbeweging appeared. Resistance increased in Twente, at the ANDB and at the NV of Rail and Tram staff. In February 1941 it came to a legendary act of resistance, the February strike. Commissioner Woudenberg prohibited the NVV from supporting the strike. Individual NVV members participated in the strike, but the NVV directors remained aloof. Nevertheless, a number of NVV members were detained for a short time on suspicion of involvement. After attempts by Woudenberg to further centralize the NVV, Twente directors resigned their positions, after which the unions flowed empty. Three directors who played a prominent role in this resistance were arrested in May 1941. G. Visser and K. Tabak died in a concentration camp. This affair caused growing criticism of the NVV board.

***Equalization of confessional unions***When the occupier Woudenberg also appointed as commissioner of the confessional trade unions in the summer of 1941, these organizations refused to cooperate. A number of (former) NVV directors were then appointed as agents to abolish the unions. One NVV employee refused this work, H. Oosterhuis. The others took the job. Despite appeals to resign from work in solidarity, a majority of NVV directors decided to continue working. In the illegal magazine De Vakbeweging and in the illegal brochure Het NVV in de branding, calls were made to cease work and remain faithful to the democratic principles that the trade union movement stood for.

***End of the independent trade union movement***That it did not stop with the abolition of the Christian and Catholic unions, became clear with the establishment of the Dutch Labor Front (NAF) on 1 May 1942. The establishment meant the introduction of national-socialist principles in the Dutch trade union movement. This was the order of the day for the NVV directors, who resigned after two years of occupation. The acquisition largely failed, only 100,000 of the 300,000 NVV members became members of the NAF. The NVV did not become a resistance organization, but several NVV members ended up in illegality. In the years 1942-1944 the presidents of the canceled NVV unions continued to meet. NVV drivers were involved in the creation of the April-May strike of 1943. And among others G. Joustra played an important role in the railroad strike of 1944.

***NVV after the takeover***Already during the occupation consultations were held about the trade union movement after the war and possible cooperation with the confessional trade union federations and the employers' organizations. At the beginning of 1943, former NVV chairman Kupers wrote a few notes for the socio-economic order of the Netherlands after the liberation. Trade union officials from the various trade union federations and also from employers' organizations met illegally for consultation. Among other things, the consultations resulted in the Council of Vakcentralen and the Labor Foundation.

***The NVV released***September 1944, the south of the Netherlands was liberated. The NVV had suffered many material and immaterial losses and many members of the NVV had died. The NVV had to be rebuilt amid the damage and chaos that the war had left behind. The NVV fought fiercely for the return of the old trade unions. In addition, it turned against the Unity Trade Union Movement (EVB), a unity organization with a communist signature. Members were approached via a relay service, NVV buildings were put back into use, the greenhouse had to be refilled. Because the trade unions were not allowed to publish their own magazine, they decided to jointly publish the magazine Herrijzing. Only in April 1945 did its own NVV magazine De Vakbeweging reappear. A month later, the whole of the Netherlands was liberated,

***Purification***Liberation flared up the discussion about purification in the trade union movement. A council of honor had to determine which union leaders were not allowed to return to their old positions. In May 1945, the council set to work on the following task: "to examine the question of whether, through certain occupations, former officials or members of the modern or neutral trade union movement, the principles, objectives or honor of the trade union movement, they belonged are harmed. " In a report, the Council of Honor ruled: "There will come a time when legitimate optimism and will go on to persist in opportunism and compliance." The founding date of the Dutch Labor Front was chosen as the reference date. The driver who subsequently cooperated with the occupier, was not allowed to return to a board position after 1945. For example, the NVV wanted to clean in-house and to cope with criticism. In total, the honor council judged 150 people in 105 cases.

What can I transcode?

- The resilience of the large group (refusing to give up)
- Why is the woman on the artifact? And why grapes?
- The ANMB logo (to do with other logos, other logos?)
- Material? (ceramic, white, glossed)
- What happened in the 50 years(find important events, people, ideas...)
- The shape of the ceramic piece(why is it made out of blocks, maybe building reference etc...)

Material/Medium: what happens when I try to represent the 50 years of the NVV in a different medium?

BOOKEND maybe?

See how many different ones are there? Are there different ones even...?

Idea of a copy of a copy

Museum, other people - get in touch to find info about the artist, when was it made.

Maybe it is a thing a thing to say thank you to the members(corporate gift)(wondering how many corporate gifts will last/be in archive)

It was made, by relief, white, gloss. What is that concept in another medium? WHAT IS THIS IN MIAGE, SOUND ETC....
